## Built with:

- [Spark](http://sparkjava.com/) : Our Backend/web framework is built on Spark

- [FTL](https://freemarker.apache.org/) : Our views are all rendered on FTL

- [MongoDB](https://freemarker.apache.org/) : Our main data storage is done with MongoDB

## Development:

- Clone the BlogCast repository:

```
git clone git@github.com:codezoned/BlogCast.git
```

- Install MongoDB if you haven't already

- Start a MongoDB instance using:

```
mongod
```

- Open the BlogCast project in IntelliJ Idea (You can use any other IDE you want, But we'll recommend IntelliJ)

- Let the plugins Install and then run the **BlogController.java**

- The Blog instance should start in //localhost:PORT



**The project is in a very alpha stage. So stay away from production :sweat_smile:**



## Maintainers:

We're always looking out for people who're enthusiastic to work and collaborate with people. If you want to become a maintainer at BlogCast you can contact us support@codezoned.com
